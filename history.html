            <p>Dr. Antonio Laperal Tamayo, founder and his wife Dr. Daisy Moran Tamayo, co-founder together with their friend, Ernesto Palanca Crisostomo, established on February 5, 1975 in Las Piňas City the Perpetual Help College of Rizal, now the University of Perpetual Help System DALTA Las Piňas.</p>
            <p>The first school building consisting of four floors (the present hospital) was constructed in a remarkable record-breaking period of only four months, which ordinarily takes one year to construct. The school building was created to house the College of Nursing. Around 700 nursing student were enrolled and a few were referrals from the Perpetual Help School in Manila. Perpetual was indeed on its way to becoming a premier university south of Metro Manila.</p>
            <p>The organizational structure of the former Perpetual Help College of Rizal has interwoven within its fabric a closely-knit group of administrators and educators. The administrative expertise of Mr. Crisostomo, the educational and supervisory proficiency of former Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila acting President and the Perpetual – Biñan First Chancellor Benjamin L. Intal and former Bureau of Private Schools Regional Director Teofilo Gallardo were the forefront keys in the formulation of the institution. The other members of the founding group are the University’s First Chancellor Dr. Grace R. De Leon whose loyalty stood by and supported the founders in hurling the challenges of organizational growth; University Registrar Dr. Perla R. Sope, and consultants ADMU’s Emiliano Armas of the Ateneo De Manila University and the De La Salle University’s Oscar Bautista, Col. Jose C. Moran, father of Dr. Daisy, a Certified Public Accountant and former President of the Continental Bank, facilitated the needed funds of the project through his friends and the Development Bank of the Philippines, where he served as its first manager of branches and agencies.</p>
